# vector with complex numbers
# | 1 3i | - complex number, imaginery is 3
# |  -2i | - complex number (real # is 0), imaginery is 2
# |   4  | - real number
# |  -5  | - real number


# dot product
# | 1 3i | * | 6 2i |
# |  -2i |   |  8   |
# |   4  |   |  3i  |
# |  -5  |   |  -5  |


# = (1 3i)(6 2i) + -16i + 12i + 25
# = 6 + 2i + 18i - 6 - 16i + 12i + 25
# = 25 + 16i
